The reception is professional courteous and accommodating, I was welcomed by Charan and Aaron who made me feel more than welcome,helped me out with the bookings. I guess they have great chef as the breakfast buffet on both days was exceptionally good, every item served inspite of the variety was tasty. Moreover bakery items were super fresh, authentic and delectable something I sorely missed in other Radisson or any other 4 or 5 star hotels. Had great experience throughout, had issues with the AC that was promptly fixed, every request was entertained. I am impressed. 4 Star for the Rooms, cause after having had stayed at the Radisson Blu, even the classiest and spacious rooms feel mediocre, lol. And appreciate the chocolates and fruits offered as welcome treat and the good night ones. Nice. The best part is right outside the hotel there is cab stand and you get bikes on rent. Which was very convenient. The beach is nearby, but I used the bike to explore the place. The next day booked the cab from the same point, great guys friendly and reasonable.",

          "Disrespected, Disappointed & Left with Poha – Not the Radisson Experience I Expected. This was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I’ve ever had. We were told by Radisson staff that breakfast is served till 11 AM. Based on that, we walked in around 10:37 AM—still within the window we were assured of. What happened next was beyond humiliating: the staff started clearing the buffet right in front of us, removing dishes as we tried to pick our plates. No warning. No courtesy. Not even the decency to let us scoop a single item before they stripped the counters clean. We were left standing with empty plates, offered nothing but leftover poha and a few pieces of fruit—not even an apology, let alone a gesture to make up for it. No effort was made to help, no concern shown for guests who were just 7 minutes late based on THEIR timing. This isn’t how a premium hotel treats its guests. Hospitality is about care, not clockwork cruelty. If you value respect and basic courtesy, look elsewhere. This Radisson didn’t deliver service—it delivered disappointment.",

Great location - 5-7 minute walk to beach. Staff was Excellent - right from check-in onwards, everyone I interacted with were A+ If we end up again in Goa - I would choose to stay here. Minor Issue : Had difficulty with channels on TV. Could not get IPL - English commentary. IPL - Hindi was available, though, Not a dealbreaker, but something to improve",

          "Not Worth the Hype – Poor Service, No Activities, Zero Hospitality One of the most disappointing stays I’ve had at a so-called premium hotel. We were told breakfast was till 11 AM—but when we reached at 10:37, the staff cleared the buffet right in front of us without letting us take even a bite. We were left standing with empty plates and offered nothing but cold poha and fruits. No apology, no courtesy, nothing. To make it worse, they promised night-time activities and shows—none of it existed. The staff was laid-back and disinterested; even basic requests took forever. We waited 40-50 minutes just to get help for the TV connection. Only thing they seemed really eager to know was when we’d check out. If you’re expecting warmth, service, or even basic professionalism, this Radisson won’t deliver. Extremely poor hospitality for the price.",
